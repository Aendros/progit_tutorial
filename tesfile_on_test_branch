Here is a file in the new created branch test. This file can be merged in the master 
branch after revision, or rebase as you wish.

Ok, now we had already merged "test" branch on our main branch "master".
Now, we make some changes on this file, to test the ability of git, and try
merging our new modified file in the main branch. Let's see what's happend.
